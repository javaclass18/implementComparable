# implementComparable
For this assignment, you will be updating the Time class from Assignment 1. To get started, you can either make a copy of your Assignment 1 Time.java, or download the solution, Time.java. First, you will need to update Time so that it implements the Comparable interface. This will require adding an implements statement to the class declaration as well as the compareTo method. Then, you will need to add a difference method to the class. These two methods' requirements are as follows: compareTo(Object other)     //Returns -1 if current time is less than other.     //Returns 0 if current time is equal to other.     //Returns 1 if current time is greater than other.  String difference(Time t)     //Returns a String holding the difference between the current time and      //the Time t passed in via parameter. All values should be positive,      //and in the format:      //Time difference: 08:09      //Time difference: 10:35
